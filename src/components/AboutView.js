            I am Mario Domenech, an entry-level front-end developer.
            For the last year I have been building my skills and knowledge on programming focusing most of the time on front-end focused technologies with the last couple months focusing on making programs and application to test said skills. 
            I have experience with various front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On top of that I am experienced with multiple JavaScript libraries and frameworks like React JS, Express JS, and Node JS. As well as familiarity using the MongoDB database for various.
            I enjoy learning and working on projects that allow me to test my skills and learn new technologies that further my understanding of web development and software engineering as a whole.
